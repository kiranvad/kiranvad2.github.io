## Research Interests
My main research interests are learning representations for data-efficient scientific discovery and understanding of physical phenomenon. 
Representations play key role in realizing the dream of autonomous experimental design using techniques such as active learning and reinforcement learning. 
I am interested in developing frameworks to understand materials based on their topology and (differential) geometry that are both computationally tractable 
and interpretable.
