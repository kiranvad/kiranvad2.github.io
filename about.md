## Research Interests
My main research interests are learning representations for data-efficient scientific discovery and understanding of physical phenomenon. 
Representations play key role in realizing the dream of autonomous experimental design using techniques such as active learning and reinforcement learning. 
I am interested in developing frameworks to understand materials based on their topology and (differential) geometry that are both computationally tractable 
and interpretable.

I am an ardent [cricket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket) fan and spend a lot of my free time watching, analyzing and writing about the beatiful game I've been watching for the better part of 18 years!<br/>
Off late, I got into watching [Formula 1](https://www.formula1.com/) a lot after a long hiatus between 2017-2021 (partly because of COVID and Netflix Drive to Survive) and that takes most of my weekends nowadays.
