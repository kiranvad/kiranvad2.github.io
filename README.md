## Welcome to my personal webpage.

I am a PhD student at the department of [Materials Design and Innovation](http://engineering.buffalo.edu/materials-design-innovation.html), Univeristy at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA. 

I am working at the interface of Machine learning and Computational Material Sciences. 

Previously, I spent five wonderful years at the prestigious [Indian Institute of Technlogy Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) and obtained bachelors and masters from the department of Mechanical Engineering.

## Research Interests
My main research interests are learning representations for data-efficient scientific discovery and understanding of physical phenomenon. Representations play key role in realizing the dream of autonomous experimental design using techniques such as active learning and reinforcement learning. I am interested in developing frameworks to understand materials based on their topology and (differential) geometry that are both computationally tractable and interpretable.
