Few of my notes that I used for teaching over the years can be found here. Please feel free to send me an email if something from these topics is not clear.

1. Notes of Riemannian Geometry and PCA

I mentored a group of 5 students from the Materials Science and Engineering department for the DIRECT-CAPSTONE project at UW. I have made the following (hand written) notes for them to provide a prime on [Riemannian geometry](data/teaching/capstone/riemannian_geometry.pdf) and [PCA](data/teaching/pca.pdf). I believe these are written to be as intuitive as possible and would be thrilled some of you find them useful as well.
